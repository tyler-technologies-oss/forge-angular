<app-demo-card headerText="Dialog Service Example" [fullWidth]="true">

  <p>
    The Dialog service will keep track of dialogs that have been opened.  
    When the dialog is closed, the service will destroy the reference.
  </p>

  <p>
    From the service, all dialogs can be closed by calling <code>closeAllDialogs()</code>.
  </p>

  <h2 class="forge-typography--subheading2">Example Use:</h2>

  <p>
    If your application includes a session idle monitoring service, the dialog service can be invoked to close all active dialogs when the idle service logs out the user. 
    This ensures that there is no inadvertent access due to an open dialog when the session terminates.
